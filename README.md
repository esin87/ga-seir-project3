## User Stories

We planned this website for a busy user, such as a working parent, who wants to find a quick treat for their family and/or children. The desserts shouldn't break the bank or require too much culinary finesse. This is not the Great British Baking Show. All our desserts are fun, fast, easy, and tasty.

-  **What does our user want?** Our user wants to find some dessert inspiration. Many cooking and recipe websites are slow to load, filled with ads and automatically playing videos that detract from the user experience. We wanted to provide a quick way for busy users to find dessert inspo.
-  **How will our application satisfy the user?** The user will be able to see an assortment of different dessert recipe ideas and click on the item to read it. Users who try out recipes and want to edit them can update any aspect of a recipe. Users can also delete recipes that are unsuccessful from the database.
