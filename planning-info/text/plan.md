User Story: 
An easy website for the working parent to find a quick treat for the kids that doesn’t break the bank or require too much culinary finesse. Fun, fast, easy, tasty desserts. 
The user wants to find some dessert inspiration and see a feed of dessert pictures and names. The user can click on an item in the feed to read more, edit, or delete the item, and are asked to confirm before submitting changes/deletes.
The feed populates by most recent post. 
The home page offers the user options to click on a category of desserts and see only desserts of that category (name and description), then can go to show page.
The home page also offers the user create functionality, so they can create a new post, publish it, and see it populate immediately to the stream. 

Ad free - easy to read - quick load …. No auto videos ….

Tuesday morning: have back end - postman full crud tested
_probs
Have some front end - can show can create - need some tweeks. To edit and create and delete from front end.

Need to tweek ingredients and steps arrays show / create.

Redirect from form on submit in react back to show page after create / edit home page - sop data goes to api before being rendered

----solve
After create - data exists - redirect to home page - done
After edit - data exists - redirect to home page -



Other thoughts…

Make unique titles / names

Form validation / required / min max length?
